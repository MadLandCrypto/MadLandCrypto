MADLAND

We have taken serious anti-bot/snipe measurements that can not be shared before the launch. 
We have not yet set a date for the publication of the contract but it will be published in the next few weeks.

We will lock the liquidity for a minimum of 1 year. After 9 months the community will decide about the years will we add to this lock.
In this way we keep it transparant and safe.

For the wallets we have we will use Multisig from Gnosis. All boardmembers will have a key to the wallet.
When someone wants to make a transaction, they need a minimum of 2/3 of the keys to approve it.
In this way the wallets will be more safe for all of us.

- Update 22/10/2021 -
Gnosis Multisig wallets are down due to a node failure and we have been forced to use temporary wallets until they are up and running.


- After the launch we will share the contract here -
